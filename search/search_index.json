See the description of this extension for instructions on how to read signature_def INT STRING DOUBLE LONG FLOAT BOOL Examples EXAMPLE 1 define stream InputStream (x Object, y Object); @info(name = 'query1') from InputStream#tensorFlow:predict('home/MNIST', 'inputPoint', 'dropout', 'outputPoint', x, y) select outputPoint0, outputPoint1, outputPoint2, outputPoint3, outputPoint4, outputPoint5, outputPoint6, outputPoint7, outputPoint8, outputPoint9 insert into OutputStream; This is a query to get inferences from a MNIST model. This model takes in 2 inputs. One being the image as float array and other is keep probability array and sends out a Tensor with 10 elements. Our stream processor flattens the tensor and sends 10 floats each representing the probability of image being 0,1,...,9","title":"predict (Stream Processor)"}]}
